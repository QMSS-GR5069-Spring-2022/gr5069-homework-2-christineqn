In this study, you will read several scenarios and answer a number of questions afterwards.



We would greatly appreciate it if you read the scenarios carefully and are thoughtful in your responses. Once you have satisfactorily answered all questions, you will receive a passcode to input into Amazon MTurk to ensure payment.





Before starting the survey, please enter your Mechanical Turk Worker ID below.","Think of the most competitive situation you've been in during the past year or two (if you can't think of something in that timeframe, you can go further back). It could be a project, organization, job, or event that felt competitive — where people around you were doing whatever they could to get ahead and beat each other, rather than working together.
This situation may have brought out the worst in people, causing fairness and generosity to take a backseat to selfishness, ruthlessness, and even manipulation or sabotage. It may have felt like ""might is right"" and winning was everything — if you played nice, you'd end up on the bottom. This should be a situation where you were personally involved.
In the space below, please write a few sentences describing this situation.","Think of the most cooperative situation you've been in during the past year or two (if you can't think of something in that timeframe, you can go further back). It could be a project, organization, job, or event that felt cooperative — with people working together, trusting one another, and acting with generosity and honesty.
This situation may have brought out the best in people, with everyone working toward a common goal; instead of being selfish, people pulled together, helped each other, and trusted one another. In general, people showed compassion and acted in harmony. This should be a situation where you were personally involved.
